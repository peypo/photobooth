photobooth
==========

Transform a raspberry pi into a photobooth, using your DSLR camera (thanks to gphoto2).

Any comments/suggestions/questions are welcome.

How to use ?
------------
(this will be writen later ; I am working on a script in order to make it as easy as possible)

Pre-requisites
--------------
- A raspberry PI (B model highly suggested ; but it should work with any version). This script is specifically created for Raspbian http://www.raspbian.org and Raspberry Pi http://www.raspberrypi.org but should work over any Debian-based distribution.
- A DSLR camera supported by gphoto (check the huge compatibility list here: http://www.gphoto.org/doc/remote/)
- (optional) a printer (CUPS-compatible - most of them are, even if not specified)
